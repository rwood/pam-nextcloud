#
# Installation:
#   sudo cp pam_nextcloud.conf.example /etc/security/pam_nextcloud.conf
#   sudo chmod 600 /etc/security/pam_nextcloud.conf
#   sudo chown root:root /etc/security/pam_nextcloud.conf

# Group synchronization (optional, default: false)
# Automatically sync user's Nextcloud groups to local Linux groups
# Groups are created if they don't exist

[group_mapping]
# Map Nextcloud groups to specific Linux groups
# Format: nextcloud_group = linux_group1, linux_group2
# Multiple Linux groups can be specified separated by commas
#
# Examples:
# admins = sudo
# developers = docker, sudo
# staff = users
# students = users
#
# If not mapped, groups will be created with their Nextcloud names (normalized for Linux)
